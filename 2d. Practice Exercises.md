Sample:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
  int savannahCookies = 6;
  int billCookies = 2;
  int totalCookies = billCookies + savannahCookies;
  printf ("Bill has %d cookies. Savannah has %d cookies. Together, they both have %d cookies in total.", billCookies, savannahCookies, totalCookies);
  return 0;
}
```
Output:
```c
Bill has 2 cookies. Savannah has 6 cookies. Together, they both have 8 cookies in total.
```
The sample reviews the variable assignment from Lesson 1. It also shows how the order of variables in the ```printf``` function corresponds to its respective ```%d``` placement. The output shows the value of the variables within a string. There are many other ways to write this program as well.

1. Candice went hiking in a nearby mountainous forest area. She travelled 709km in order to reach the forest, and used 58.3 litres of fuel along the way there. Initialize and assign a value to variables for the total distance she travelled and the total amount of fuel she used with appropriate data types.<br><br>
2. While Candice walked in the woods, she saw 5 squirrels and 12 birds. In total, she saw 17 animals. Initialize variables for the number of birds and squirrels she saw. Initialize and assign a value to a new variable for the total number of animals she saw and for the value, use the previous variables you made to.<br><br>
3. Candice was hungry after the hike so she bought a hot dog for $4.75. Initialize and assign a value to a variable for the cost of the hotdog.<br><br>
4. She also bought a souvenir that costed double the price of the hotdog. Initialize and assign a value to a variable for the price of the souvenir using the hotdog cost variable. Initialize and assign a value to a variable describing the total amount of money she spent.<br><br>
5. Afterwards she went gambling and spent $50 000 without gaining any profit. Candice left the casino in rage and went to become a spokeswomen at the national CSGO Anti-Gambling Addiction non-profit organization. Add the amount she spent at the casino to a new assignment of the previous total money spent variable. **Assign a new value to it. Careful not to go back to change the variable or create a new variable! <br><br>
6. Now go back to your code and after every line of variable assignment or initiaization, print a sentence that tells Candice's story with the specific variable assignment or initialization after it. Make sure every sentence is on a new line. Make sure you check if your data types are appropriate and match it with the correct format.(: <br><br>
