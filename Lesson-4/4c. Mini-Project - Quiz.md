#Mini-Project - Quiz

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

Once again, most of the program will not be defined for you. You must think __for yourself or with a group__ about what to do and how to effectively make your program.<br><br>
We will be making a quiz, some sort like Buzz Feed or the typical "What's Your Celebrity Twin Quiz". <br>
We will use __variables, operators (both basic and conditional), printf, scanf,__ and __if statements__.

##Quiz Project
Our objective: __Create a quiz that has options A, B, C, D and adds up points to find out what type of person someone is.__
 <br><br>
__Criteria__: <br><br>
1. Write a quiz layout; the questions, the answers, the false answers, and the add up of scores in the end (ex. scores of 1-10, you are nice; with scores of 11-20 you are rude; with scores of 21-30 you are mean.). You can decide what type of quiz you want, and if you can't think of anything, search online for one. <br><br>
2. Your quiz program must have contain at least 10 questions with 4 different answers in each question; 1 right and 3 wrong. <br><br>
3. Initialize all variables at the top of your ```main``` function. Use appropriate data types. <br><br>
4. Use ```printf``` to print questions and answers. <br><br>
5. Use ```scanf``` to obtain the user's input (Instead of having them write the answer. Label each answer with A, B, C, or D. Have them write the letters). <br><br>
6. Use if statements to decide what points to add for each different answer. Make each answer have a different value (but mix up the answers like a multiple choice test). <br><br>
7. In the end, tell the user their total and what category of results they achieved with the total.<br><br>
8. Have the people next to you play your quiz and share it around!

__NOTE: There are different ways to code the total. Think before you code!__
