#Review
Last day we learned about if statements which were a form of branching.

##If Statements
If the expression is true, the computer will go into the brackets and execute the statement. If it is not true, then the computer will ignore the if statement (like how it ignores a comment) and skip over it.

So the __if statement__ is ignored by the computer since the expression is not true, and you write a new if statement for a condition that is opposite of what you already wrote. Now, instead we should use the __else__ statement.

The __else statement__ acts as a default. So if no conditions prove to be true, it will go to the else section of the if statement.

With an if statement, we can connect only one else segment and we can only have one if segment, but what if we need more conditions for the one if statement?<br><br>
In that case, we can add __else if__ into the if statement. An else if allows the programmer to apply another specific condition for the if statement. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
 
   /* check the boolean condition */
   if( a == 10 ) {
      /* if condition is true then print the following */
      printf("Value of a is 10\n" );
   }
   else if( a == 20 ) {
      /* if else if condition is true */
      printf("Value of a is 20\n" );
   }
   else if( a == 30 ) {
      /* if else if condition is true  */
      printf("Value of a is 30\n" );
   }
   else {
      /* if none of the conditions is true */
      printf("None of the values is matching\n" );
   }
   
   printf("Exact value of a is: %d\n", a );
 
   return 0;
}
```

##Conditional Operators

__NOT:__ The NOT operator accepts one input. If that input is TRUE, it returns FALSE, and if that input is FALSE, it returns TRUE. For example, NOT (1) evaluates to 0, and NOT (0) evaluates to 1. NOT (any number but zero) evaluates to 0. In C NOT is written as !. NOT is evaluated prior to both AND and OR. 

__AND:__ This is another important command. AND returns TRUE if both inputs are TRUE (if 'this' AND 'that' are true). (1) AND (0) would evaluate to zero because one of the inputs is false (both must be TRUE for it to evaluate to TRUE). (1) AND (1) evaluates to 1. (any number but 0) AND (0) evaluates to 0. The AND operator is written && in C. Do not be confused by thinking it checks equality between numbers: it does not. Keep in mind that the AND operator is evaluated before the OR operator. 

__OR:__ Very useful is the OR statement! If either (or both) of the two values it checks are TRUE then it returns TRUE. For example, (1) OR (0) evaluates to 1. (0) OR (0) evaluates to 0. The OR is written as || in C. Keep in mind that OR will be evaluated after AND. 

It is possible to combine several Boolean operators in a single statement; often you will find doing so to be of great value when creating complex expressions for if statements. What is !(1 && 0)? Of course, it would be TRUE. It is true is because 1 && 0 evaluates to 0 and !0 evaluates to TRUE (i.e., 1). 

Here are the common operators that you will need to learn and use:
```c
>     /* greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE */
<     /* less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE */
>=    /* greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE */
<=    /* less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE */
==    /* equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE */
!=    /* not equal to              5 != 4 is TRUE */
```
