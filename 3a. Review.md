#Review
From last day, we went over __comments__ and __printf function__.

##Comments
We use comments to remind ourselves about __why__ we coded what we did. Comments are ignored by the computer.<br><br>

We can comment like this:
```c
/* comment */
```
Or like this:
```c
//comment
```

##Printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to output to the computer. We use ```printf``` in order to write things out.<br><br>

__Width__ is the number of spaces the variable will take. <br>
__Precision__ is the number of spaces after the decimal the variable will have.<br>
And lastly, the __format__ is the symbol that represents your variable. It represents the variables that come chronologically after the comma.
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a,b;
    float c,d;

    a = 15;
    b = a / 2;
    printf("%d\n",b);
    printf("%3d\n",b);
    printf("%03d\n",b);

    c = 15.3;
    d = c / 3;
    printf("%3.2f\n",d);

    return 0;
}
```
Everything inside the quotation marks will be shown in the output. We can write sentences inside the quotation marks, and we also use __escape sequences__ such as ```\n```.
