#Data Types

[C Compiler - Click here] (https://ideone.com/)

A data type is the _kind_ of data used and specifies how much memory is allocated. Coding in languages such as C++ allows a programmer to be more aware of memory location, however for C, all we need to understand is that different types of data occupy different amounts of space within storage.
<br><br>
Data types can also refer to the declaration of different variables or functions. It may determine what operations can be performed with the variable.<br>
This lesson will introduce __Basic Integer Types__. Similar to how in math, there are whole numbers (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), integers (ex. -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), and decimal numbers (ex. 5.635, 2.5); they all have certain criteria they require in order to be associated with the group such as integers can be negative or positive, but it cannot be a fraction or a decimal number.
###Int
Otherwise known as integers. ```int``` allows the programmer to assign a value to the variable that is similar to an integer; a positive or negative (unless the variable is ```unsigned```) number with no decimals.
__Example:__
```c
int count;
count = 5;
```
###Long
A ```long``` variable is an larger ```int``` variable that can hold a bigger value. It holds more bits, but programmers cannot assign decimal values. Long variables require a ```L``` at the end of the assigned value to declare it as a __literal__ long in order to do arithmetic and operations with it.
```c
long bigCount;
bigCount = 3004250L;
```
###Float
Floats are similar to ```int``` with its only different being that the purpose of a ```float``` is to assign a decimal number. They are real numbers.
```c
float approxPi;
approxPi = 3.14;
```
###Double
Doubles can be used to assign bigger floats, so one can use ```double``` for large decimal numbers. When you would use ```float``` rather than ```double``` or vice versa depends on the precision you require. If you do not come close to larger numbers, then your best guess is to use ```float```. They are also real numbers.
```c
double atomCount;
atomCount = 2500000
```
###Char
Char variables consist of one letter and is short for "character". In order to use an entire sentence instead of one letter, the computer uses ```string``` however that will be covered next lesson. With ```char```, the programmer must remember to put the letter value within two ```'``` and not two double quotation marks ```"```. Char variable values are case sensitive as well.
```c
char letter;
letter = 'a';
```
