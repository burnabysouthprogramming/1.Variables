#Data Types

A data type is the _kind_ of data used and specifies how much memory is allocated. Coding in languages such as C++ allows a programmer to be more aware of memory location, however for C, all we need to understand is that different types of data occupy different amounts of space within storage.

Data types can also refer to the declaration of different variables or functions. It may determine what operations can be performed with the variable.<br>
This lesson will introduce __Basic Integer Types__. Similar to how in math, there are whole numbers (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), integers (ex. -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), and decimal numbers (ex. 5.635, 2.5); they all have certain criteria they require in order to be associated with the group such as integers can be negative or positive, but it cannot be a fraction or a decimal number.

###Int
Otherwise known as integers. ```int``` allows the programmer to assign a value to the variable that is similar to an integer; a positive or negative (unless the variable is ```unsigned```) number with no decimals.
__Example:__
```c
int count;
count = 5;
```
###Float
Floats are similar to ```int``` with its only different being that the purpose of a ```float``` is to assign a decimal number.
```c
float approxPi;
approxPi = 3.14;
```
###Double
Doubles can be used to assign bigger floats, so one can use ```double``` for large decimal numbers. When you would use ```float``` rather than ```double``` or vice versa depends on the precision you require. If you do not come close to larger numbers, then your best guess is to use ```float```.
```c
double atomCount;
atomCount = 2500000
```
