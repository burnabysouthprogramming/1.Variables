#Data Types

[C Compiler - Click here] (https://ideone.com/)

A data type is the _kind_ of data used and specifies how much memory is allocated. Coding in languages such as C++ allows a programmer to be more aware of memory location, however for C, all we need to understand is that different types of data occupy different amounts of space within storage.
<br><br>
Data types can also refer to the declaration of different variables or functions. It may determine what operations can be performed with the variable.<br>
This lesson will introduce __Basic Integer Types__. Similar to how in math, there are whole numbers (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), integers (ex. -1, 0, 1, 2, 3), and decimal numbers (ex. 5.635, 2.5); they all have certain criteria they require in order to be associated with the group such as integers can be negative or positive, but it cannot be a fraction or a decimal number.
###Int
Otherwise known as integers. ```int``` allows the programmer to assign a value to the variable that is similar to an integer; a positive or negative (unless the variable is ```unsigned```) number with no decimals.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
__Example:__
```c
int count;
count = 5;
```
###Long
A ```long``` variable is an larger ```int``` variable that can hold a bigger value. It holds more bits, but programmers cannot assign decimal values. Long variables require a ```L``` at the end of the assigned value to declare it as a __literal__ long in order to do arithmetic and operations with it.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
```c
long bigCount;
bigCount = 3004250L;
```
###Float
Floats are similar to ```int``` with its only different being that the purpose of a ```float``` is to assign a decimal number. They are real numbers and you need to write ```f``` at the end of the value to make it a literal float.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
```c
float approxPi;
approxPi = 3.14f;
```
###Double
Doubles can be used to assign bigger floats, so one can use ```double``` for large decimal numbers. When you would use ```float``` rather than ```double``` or vice versa depends on the precision you require. If you do not come close to larger numbers, then your best guess is to use ```float```. They are also real numbers and you need to write ```d``` at the end of the value to make it a literal double.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
```c
double atomCount;
atomCount = 2500000d;
```
###Char
Char variables consist of one letter and is short for "character". In order to use an entire sentence instead of one letter, the computer uses ```string``` however that will be covered next lesson. With ```char```, the programmer must remember to put the letter value within two ```'``` and not two double quotation marks ```"```. Char variable values are case sensitive as well.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
```c
char letter;
letter = 'a';
```
###Bool
Bool, short for boolean, is a data type that represents only two values; true or false. Usually, the number ```1``` is used to represent ```true``` and the number ```0``` represents ```false```. Bools will be covered in further detail in a future lesson for conditional statements.
__Please refer to the table at the bottom to figure out the range of values that this data type allows.__
```c
bool condition;
condition = 1;
```

## Byte Amount, Range, Unsigned
<img src = "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kZJ5W_9KWSw/U-TitW0LYPI/AAAAAAAAAnY/4n1ly0bh0aE/s1600/DATA-TYPES-IN-C.jpg"><br><br>
The image above shows the storage required for each variable declaration and depicts the differences between ```int``` and ```long``` as well as other mentioned variables. The range of a variable shows the maximum and minimum value that can be assigned to a certain variable type. 
<br><br>
Unsigned variables do not take negative values. They also have a different precision than the regular data type it correlates with. For those who want to learn more about unsigned variables; signed integers have undefined behavior if they overflow, while unsigned integers wrap around using modulo.
<br><br>
Ignore the format section of the image for now, but be aware of them. They will be covered in the next lesson.
<br><br>
##Default Values
So what happens to a variable when they are not assigned a value, such as the one below.
```c
int noValue;
```
<br>
The variables in C are automatically assigned a certain value if you do not assign a value to it yourself. The __default value__ depends on the type of variable it is.<br>

<br><br>
Note: The ```char``` and ```string``` values are null. 

## TL;DR
__Why do data types matter?__ <br>
Because we should try and find the range that we need for the values of that variable. If we were to make a game, saving space with data types might mean the difference between a 50MB game and a 100MB game. Thus we want to find the most appropriate data type.
