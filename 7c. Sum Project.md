#Sum of 0 to N Project

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

With this project, you can __work alone or up to groups of 3__.

We will be making a Sum of 0-N Program that gives out an output of the sum of all the natural numbers before and including the number that the user inputs. We will use __variables, operators, printf, scanf, switch statements/if statements, and for loops.__

##Sum of 0-N Project
Our objective: __Create a program that takes a number from the user and adds up a sum of all the numbers from 0 to the number itself.__

1. Plan out the structure of your program, whether you write it down, have an idea in your head or tell your partner(s). <br><br>
2. Start your program by introducing the sum machine and provide instructions for the user to follow and input his/her desired number.<br><br>
3. Initialize any and all variables at the top (unless they are in a function, then you initialize them within the function).<br><br>
4. Use ```printf``` to list out instructions and give the results of the program.<br><br>
5. Use ```scanf``` to gather the user's desired number.<br><br>
6. Use an ```if statement``` to __make sure the user picks a number above 0__.
