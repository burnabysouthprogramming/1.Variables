A __loop__ gives a program the ability to repeat a group of statements, sometimes for a given count or duration, or, often, until a certain condition is met. The C language gives you many ways to create loops in your code, but the most common is the for loop.

A __for loop__ is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute _a specific number of times._

##Syntax and Parts Of A (For) Loops
A for loop has three parts:

* __The setup__
* __The exit condition for which the loop finishes__
* __The part that loops, which is the statements that are repeated__

The syntax of a for loop in C programming language is −
```c
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
   statement(s);
}
```

Here is the flow of control in a 'for' loop −

* The __init step__ is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.

* Next, the __condition__ is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and the flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the 'for' loop.

* After the body of the 'for' loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the __increment__ statement. This statement allows you to update any loop control variables. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the condition.

* The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop, then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the 'for' loop terminates.

##In-Depth Explanation

In the C language, the for loop can handle these conditions in one handy statement, which makes it easy to understand, despite how complex it looks.

There was once a time when teachers would punish students by making them write some life lesson, say "I shall refrain from calling my friends names," on the chalkboard 100 times. The following program does the same thing on a computer screen in less than one second:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int c;
    for(c=0;c<100;c=c+1)
    {
        puts("I shall refrain from calling my friends names.");
    }
    return(0);
}
```

When you save the source code to disk, compile it, and run it, you get this:

I shall refrain from calling my friends names.
I shall refrain from calling my friends names.
I shall refrain from calling my friends names.
And so on, for 100 lines. Here's how it works:

The for keyword is followed by a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses are three separate items that configure the loop. Consider the preceding for loop:
```c
for(c=0;c<100;c=c+1)
```

The c variable is already defined as an int (integer). It's used by the for loop to control how many times the loop — the statements belonging to for — is repeated. First comes the setup:
```c
c=0
```

The variable c is assigned the value 0. The for statement does this first, before the loop is ever repeated, and then only once.

Note that starting at 0 rather than 1 is a traditional C language thing. Zero is the "first" number. Get used to that.

Next comes the exit condition:
```c
c<100
```

The loop repeats itself as long as the value of variable c is less than 100. Finally, here's the "do this" part of the loop:
```c
c=c+1
```

Each time the loop is repeated, the for statement executes this statement. It must be a real C language statement, one that you hope somehow manipulates the variable that's set up in the first step. Here, the value of variable c is increased, or incremented, by one.

The loop itself consists of the statements following for. These are enclosed in braces:
```c
for(c=0;c<100;c=c+1)
{
    puts("I shall refrain from calling my friends names.");
}
```

Or, since there is only one statement after for, you can eliminate the braces:
```c
for(c=0;c<100;c=c+1)
    puts("I shall refrain from calling my friends names."
```

##Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   int a;
	
   /* for loop execution */
   for( a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1 ){
      printf("value of a: %d\n", a);
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```
And the output is:
```c
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
```

Write a program to find the sum of first n natural numbers where n is entered by user. Note: 1,2,3... are called natural numbers.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int n, count, sum=0;
    printf("Enter the value of n.\n");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(count=1;count<=n;++count)  //for loop terminates if count>n
    {
        sum+=count;    /* this statement is equivalent to sum=sum+count */
    }
    printf("Sum=%d",sum);
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```c
Enter the value of n.
19
Sum=190
```
