#Output with printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to see the data behind their code. ```printf``` does not come with the C language, it's a part of a certain library that you include in your code when you write ```#include <stdio.h>``` at the top of your code. You can use it to show the values of your variables.
You can also use it to write messages that the computer takes in and translates as an output.<br>
This is similar to the "input/output" system that high schoolers learn about in Grade 8 where you can put in a value and another value comes out.
The computer is the machine that takes your value, translates, then executes it into a readable form for humans.<br><br>

This is where we start seeing the usage of __variable__ and __data types__.

##Formats
```c
#include <stdio.h> //Required for input and output on C language

int main (void) {
  int exampleVariable = 2;
  
  //A basic printf function used for printing out variables
  printf ("%d\n", exampleVariable);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Now what is ```%d```, ```\n```, and why does the variable come after it? What are the quotations?<br><br>
