#Output - printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to see the data behind their code. You can use it to show the values of your variables.
You can also use it to write messages that the computer takes in and translates as an output.<br>
This is similar to the "input/output" system that high schoolers learn about in Grade 8 where you can put in a value and another value comes out.
The computer is the machine that takes your value, translates, then executes it into a readable form for humans.<br><br>

This is where we start seeing the usage of __variable__ and __data types__. <br><br>
