#Output with printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to see the data behind their code. ```printf``` does not come with the C language, it's a part of a certain library that you include in your code when you write ```#include <stdio.h>``` at the top of your code. You can use it to show the values of your variables.
You can also use it to write messages that the computer takes in and translates as an output.<br>
This is similar to the "input/output" system that high schoolers learn about in Grade 8 where you can put in a value and another value comes out.
The computer is the machine that takes your value, translates, then executes it into a readable form for humans.<br><br>

This is where we start seeing the usage of __variable__ and __data types__.

##Formats
```c
#include <stdio.h> //Required for input and output on C language

int main (void) {
  int exampleVariable = 2;
  
  //A basic printf function used for printing out variables
  printf ("%d\n", exampleVariable);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Now what is ```%d```, ```\n```, and why does the variable come after it? What are the quotations?<br><br>
* ```%d``` is the __format specifier__. A fancier word for saying that ```%d``` represents your variable. It determines where it is placed in a sentence and also it needs to correlate with your data type.
* ```\n``` is part of a group of __escape sequences__. In this case it represents a newline character. After printing something to the screen you usually want to print something on the next line. If there is no ```\n``` then a next printf command will print the string on the same line.
* Lastly, from before the ```%d``` is the representation of a variable, so the variable after the format tells the computer which variable to print. Instead of %d showing up as an output, it will be replaced by the value ```2``` of the ```exampleVariable``` variable.
<br>
The ```printf``` function uses quotes inside the brackets to signify the parts it will output. The code inside the quotation marks will be printed out by the computer.

Now with my incredible Photoshop skills, I cut the data types table in order to list all the formats: <br><br>

__Refer to the format of each data type for printing out variables. If you mix up the pair of format-data type then the computer will not print out the variable correctly!__
