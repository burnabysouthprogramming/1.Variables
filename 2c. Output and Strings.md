#Output with printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to see the data behind their code. ```printf``` does not come with the C language, it's a part of a certain library that you include in your code when you write ```#include <stdio.h>``` at the top of your code. You can use it to show the values of your variables.
You can also use it to write messages that the computer takes in and translates as an output.<br>
This is similar to the "input/output" system that high schoolers learn about in Grade 8 where you can put in a value and another value comes out.
The computer is the machine that takes your value, translates, then executes it into a readable form for humans.<br><br>

This is where we start seeing the usage of __variable__ and __data types__.

##Formats
```c
#include <stdio.h> //Required for input and output on C language

int main (void) {
  int exampleVariable = 2;
  
  //A basic printf function used for printing out variables
  printf ("%d\n", exampleVariable);
  
  return 0;
}
```
Now what is ```%d```, ```\n```, and why does the variable come after it? What are the quotations?<br><br>
* ```%d``` is the __format specifier__. A fancier word for saying that ```%d``` represents your variable. It determines where it is placed in a sentence and also it needs to correlate with your data type.
* ```\n``` is part of a group of __escape sequences__. In this case it represents a newline character. After printing something to the screen you usually want to print something on the next line. If there is no ```\n``` then a next printf command will print the string on the same line.
* Lastly, from before the ```%d``` is the representation of a variable, so the variable after the format tells the computer which variable to print. Instead of %d showing up as an output, it will be replaced by the value ```2``` of the ```exampleVariable``` variable.
<br>
The ```printf``` function uses quotes inside the brackets to signify the parts it will output. The code inside the quotation marks will be printed out by the computer.

Now with my incredible Photoshop skills, I cut the data types table in order to list all the formats: <br><br>

__Refer to the format of each data type for printing out variables. If you mix up the pair of format-data type then the computer will not print out the variable correctly!__

##Width & Precision
What is the width and precision when it comes to printing variables?<br>
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int a,b;
	float c,d;

	a = 15;
	b = a / 2;
	printf("%d\n",b);
	printf("%3d\n",b);
	printf("%03d\n",b);
	
	c = 15.3;
	d = c / 3;
	printf("%3.2f\n",d);
}
```
Which has the output of:
```
7
   7
007
5.10
```
<br>
As you can see in the __first__ printf statement we print a decimal. <br><br>

In the __second__ printf statement we print the same decimal, but we use a __width (The 3 in front of d)__ to say that we want three digits (positions) reserved for the output.<br>
The result is that two “space characters” are placed before printing the character.<br><br>

In the __third__ printf statement we say almost the same as the previous one. Print the output with a width of three digits, but fill the space with 0.<br><br>

In the __fourth__ printf statement we want to print a float. In this printf statement we want to print three position before the decimal point __(called width)__ and two positions behind the decimal point __(called precision)__.<br><br>

__Width is the total number of digits/spaces you want for the variable, while precision is the amount of digits you want after the decimal point__
