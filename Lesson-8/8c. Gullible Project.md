#Gullible Project

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

With this project, you can __work alone or up to groups of 3__.

We will be making a 'Gullible' project that asks the person for a number that is not the number that is incremented every loop, and won't let the user continue with the program unless they pick that number. We will use __variables, operators, printf, scanf, switch statements/if statements, and loops.__

##Gullible Project
Our objective: __Write a program that continues to asks the user to enter any number other than the number equal to the number of times they've been asked to enter a number. (i.e on the first iteration "Please enter any number other than 0" and on the second iteration "Please enter any number other than 1"m etc. etc. The program must behave accordingly exiting when the user enters the number they were asked not to.)__<br>
_Optional: Modify the program so that after 20 iterations if the user still hasn't entered the desired number, it will tell the user "Wow, you're more patient then I am, you win." and exit._

1. Plan out the structure of your program, whether you write it down, have an idea in your head or tell your partner(s). <br><br>
2. Start your program by introducing the program and what it does. Tell the user to enter a number that isn't the number you mentioned.<br><br>
3. Initialize any and all variables at the top (unless they are in a function, then you initialize them within the function).<br><br>
4. Use ```printf``` to list out instructions and give the results of the program.<br><br>
5. Use ```scanf``` to gather the user's desired number.<br><br>
6. Use the necessary ```loops```.<br><br>
7. Make more functions if you feel it is necessary. Use ```if statements``` if necessary.<br><br>
8. Share your project with your friends!
