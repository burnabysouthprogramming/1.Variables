#Comments
Comments in C are very important. They are used to provide clarity to the code and allow other people to understand what the code is trying to accomplish.
Comments help in large projects, with many people working on the same script. They also help with the debugging process when you need to find errors.

It is a recommended practice to use comments often. Some say it is better to overcomment than to comment too little.

##Comment Syntax
In order to comment, we use ```/``` and ```*```. __You can put comments before or after or even right next to your actual code.__ Comments are not read by the computer; it ignores comments completely. If you assign any variables or do any coding within a comment, they will be ignored by the computer.
```c
/* comment goes here */
int variable = 2; /* oh look another comment */
```
It can also span many lines, but do not mix your actual code in between the ```/``` because they will be a part of the comment as well. 
```c
/*
 * hi im comment
 * this spans many lines
 * here is another comment
 */
```
Another style is using ```//``` only. __Keep in mind that this style only lets you comment ON THE SAME LINE, AFTER ```//```.__ This type of commenting only lasts one line and you cannot span it over many lines like above.<br><br>
For example:
```c
//this is a good comment. it also does not affect the assignment of the variable underneath
int variable 2; //also a good comment way. does not affect the actual code
//this is not good because now the creation of the variable is ignored -> int badComment = 1;
```
__Also, similar to variables, try to choose a style of commenting that suits you and use ONE style throughout your entire code in order to be consistent.__

## What Do I Write In My Comment?
Comments are very useful, but need to be used correctly and appropriately.
