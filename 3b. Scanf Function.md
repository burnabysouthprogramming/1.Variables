__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

The ```scanf``` function allows the programmer to enter an input compared to the ```printf``` function we used last day that was for outputs.<br>

Now in order to get input from a user, we still need to create the variables for storing their input. From previous lessons, we learned that variables _store_ values. We will be using variables in ```scanf```. The scanf function can do a lot of different things, but it is generally unreliable unless used in the simplest ways. It is unreliable because it does not handle human errors very well. But for simple programs it is good enough and easy-to-use.<br><br>

##Syntax

The simplest application of scanf looks like this:
```c
scanf("%d", &age);
```
The program will read in an integer value that the user enters on the keyboard (%d is for integers, as is in ```printf```, so age must be declared as an int) and place that value into b. <br><br>
Like ```printf```, the ```%d``` correlates to the variable after the comma and the quotation marks.<br>
The ```&age``` part is called a __pointer__. They will be discussed later. <br>
__You MUST put & in front of the variable used in scanf. The reason why will become clear once you learn about pointers. It is easy to forget the & sign, and when you forget it your program will almost always crash when you run it.__

##Format Specifiers
The format specifiers are identical to the ```printf``` format specifiers. Please refer to the table in Lesson 2 if you forgot them.<br>
However, a new format we must learn is ```%s```. <br>
It refers to a __string__. We will be using strings in order to write stories and make more descriptive programs.

##Char Arrays
A very important part to learn is char arrays. We will be discussing arrays in a later lesson, however for now just know that we use char arrays to define a space for more than one character.<br><br>

With ```char``` we can only assign the value of one character. With an array of a ```char```, we can assign whole sentences to one variable. <br><br>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  /* Define temporary variables */
  char name[10]; //Or char name[];
  int age;

  /* Ask the user to enter their first name and age */
  printf("Please enter your first name and your age.\n");

  /* Read a name and age from the user */
  scanf("%s %d", name, &age);

  /* Display the values the user entered */
  printf("Name: %s\n", name);
  printf("Age: %d\n", age);

  return 0;
}
```
We can see with this program that we are able to initialize new variables for the values that the user inputs. We do not assign a value to the variables yet. We print out a statement asking for name and age, however we should note that __the answers are separated by a space.__ When we enter a few values at a time, they are separated by spaces. We can test this out on our own time.<br>
Next the computer gets the values from the user and assigns it to the variables. __NOTE: The char arrays do not require an &__. Then we are able to print out the values we received from the user.
<br><br>
Put this program into the compiler to understand it. We put the inputs within the Terminal.
<br><br>

The ```char name[10];``` line defines a char array that has the size of 10. If you know how many characters the input will take, write a number in the array (and add 2 to it because it will also take /0 in it), however if you do not know, then leave it empty so the computer can make the size for you.

##Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a, b, c;
    printf("Enter the first value:");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter the second value:");
    scanf("%d", &b);
    c = a + b;
    printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  char ch;
  char str[100];
  printf(“Enter any character \n”);
  scanf(“%c”, &ch);
  printf(“Entered character is %c \n”, ch);
  printf(“Enter any string ( upto 100 character ) \n”);
  scanf(“%s”, &str);
  printf(“Entered string is %s \n”, str);
  return 0;
}          
```
