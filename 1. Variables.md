#Variables

[C Compiler - Click here] (https://ideone.com/)

Variables are essential to any computer program. Variables hold different values that can easily be changed later in the program. In a variable, you _store_ values like how a cardboard box can store shoes. One can label their shoe boxes for different types of shoes similarily to how someone can name variables for various purposes.

In a variable there is the __name__ which is on the left side (which you choose what the variable name is), an __```=``` sign__ after the name that assigns a __value__ (which is put after the ```=``` sign) to the variable name.

```c
int this_is_a_variable = 10;
```

A good habit to follow is to know what your variable is used for and when making new variables, check for its necessity.

##Styles
A good variable name is short, to the point, and is descriptive enough to describe its purpose. There area few styles of naming variables. It is __recommended to stick with one style__ while you code in order to keep the program neat.
Different programmers prefer different styles such as:

__The Underscore__
```c
float move_block_distance = 20;
int character_health = 100;
```
With the Underscore style, all words in the variable are lower-case, separated by an underscore. This is the style most commonly used by Python programmers.

__The Camel Casing__
```c
float moveBlockDistance = 20;
int characterHealth = 200;
```
With the Camel Casing style there are no underscores, however the first word is lower-case and the ones afterwards are capitalized.

The examples above are clearly defined; one can see how the variable ```move_block_distance``` is 20 which means the block movement is 20. The units (ft, meters) are not defined, but since we are working with variables, the value of ```move_block_distance``` can be changed within a program.

####Here are some examples of bad variables and bad styles:

__The Screamer__
```c
INT ENEMYHEALTH = 36;
INT BULLETDAMAGE = 4;
INT FRIENDLYFIREDAMAGE = 2;
```
While all caps variables are used in programs in certain cases, don't do this for every variable.

__Mr. LongJohns__
```c
int enemy_monster_tree_scare_green_health_after_two_days_at_night = 2;
int varTakenFromTurningBecauseItsWithThisScriptFromTheBeginning = 10;
```
You shouldn't take longer to read the variable than to understand what it does.

__The Face Smasher / The Lazy Potato__
```c
long b = 10 000;
int qdyu = 15;
float csharp = 10.3;
int cplusplus = 2;
int wper = 12;
int uper = 534;
int mper = 20;
```
The main problem for this style is that nobody, not even yourself, will be able to understand the variables and what they mean. When someone adds ```uper``` to ```qdyu``` and the computer outputs the number of ```549```, it will be more difficult to understand what the outcome means. Although a program can have hundreds of variables and can be tedious at times, it is always a good habit to create informative and readable variables.

#####IMPORTANT TO NOTE: 
* Certain symbols such as *, / or numbers cannot be used in variables since they mean something else.
* Variables are case-sensitive so ```snake``` is a different variable from ```Snake```
* The ```=``` sign when putting a value to a variable __does not__ mean that the variable is _equivalent_ to the value. The values on the right side is __assigned__ to the variable on the left. (If still hard to comprehend, the practice underneath will demonstrate how variables are assigned)
* Variable assignments are usually done at the top of the document or function. Otherwise, they are put as close as possible to where they are used.

##Mini-Lesson : Operators
In order to use variables effectively, the programmer must learn a set of operators. Operators will be covered in more depth in a later lesson, however these are a few that should be used early on:
* ```+``` is used to __add__
* ```-``` is used to __subtract__
* ```*``` is used to __multiply__
* ```/``` is used to __divide__
* ```%``` is used to divide then find the __remainder__
* ```**``` is used for __exponents__

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int exponent_value = 7 ** 3;
    print("%d", exponent_value);
    
    return 0;
}
exponent_value = 7 ** 3;
print(exponent_value);
```
The ```exponent_value``` variable would be printed as the number ```343```.

#Try It Yourself - Practice Exercises
__Use ```print(insertVariableHere)``` in order to print and see the variables inside the brackets__<br><br>
Example of a short and simple program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int totalTuitionCost = 50000;
    int startFunds = 15000;
    int riotPointsCardDollars = 50;
    int timesBoughtRiotPoints = 200;

    int totalFunds = startFunds - (riotPointsCardDollars * timesBoughtRiotPoints);
    printf ("%d \n", totalFunds);
    printf ("%d \n", (totalTuitionCost - totalFunds));
    
    return 0;
}
```
Take some time to study this program which shows how a university student used all his university funds to buy $50 RP cards and in the end, he is left with 5000 dollars in his savings account (the amount is printed with ```print(totalFunds)```). Once he gets into university he will have 45000 dollars left to pay off (the amount is printed with ```print (totalTuitionCost - totalFunds)```).<br><br><br>

__Clear everything in the script before starting. Ask Kallen or a friend next to you if you need help; don't be afraid to ask for assistance!__<br><br>


1. In a blank script, create a variable that describes the total number of Morrey's cats. Assign a value to the variable that states Morrey has 12 cats. Print the variable.<br><br>
2. One of Morrey's cats got pregnant and now Morrey has a new litter of kitties. There are 4 kitties in the litter. Add 4 cats to the total number of cats variable. Print the variable.<br><br>
3. On Monday, Morrey wants to give each cat some food. Create a new variable and assign a value that states the total amount of cat food is 1500 grams. Print the variable.<br><br>
4. Print the _remainder_ amount of cat food when each of Morrey's cats is given 50 grams. Use the two variables you previously created to complete this task.<br><br>
5. __BONUS__ How many grams would each cat get the next day (Tuesday) with only the remainder of the amount of cat food on Monday?<br><br>

####More Practice:
* Create variable ```valueone``` and ```valuetwo``` with different values. _Assign_ the second variable to the first with ```=```. Print out the first variable. Then print out the second variable. What happened with each variable?<br><br>
* What are the outputs of this program? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    printf ("%d \n", a);
    printf ("%d \n", b);
    return 0;
}
```

* What are the outputs of this program? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 3, b = 4;
    a = b;
    b = a;
    printf ("%d \n", a);
    printf ("%d \n", b);
    
    return 0;
}
```

* What are the outputs of this program? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x = 4;
    int y = x + 1;
    x = x + 2;
    printf ("%d, %d \n", x, y);
    
    return 0;
}
```

* Play around with the precedence of operators. (Ex. The computer does ```**``` before any other operator, then goes on to do ```*``` and ```/```. Use at least 3 variables and all of the operators above. Print answers.<br><br>
* Make a program similar to the example above, depicting the cost of university tuition and events (with a monetary value) that lower __or__ increase debt during college. Use at least 5 different variables.
