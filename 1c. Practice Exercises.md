#Try It Yourself - Practice Exercises

[C Compiler - Click here] (https://ideone.com/)

Example of a some variable assignments that tell a story:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int totalTuitionCost = 50000;
    int startFunds = 15000;
    int riotPointsCardDollars = 50;
    int timesBoughtRiotPoints = 200;

    int totalFunds = startFunds - (riotPointsCardDollars * timesBoughtRiotPoints);
    int moneyLeft = totalTuitionCost - totalFunds;
    
    return 0;
}
```
Take some time to study this program which shows how a university student used all his university funds to buy $50 RP cards and in the end, he is left with 5000 dollars in his savings account. Once he gets into university he will have 45000 dollars left to pay off (the amount is shown with ```int moneyLeft = totalTuitionCost - totalFunds```).<br><br><br>

1. In a blank script, create a variable that describes the total number of Morrey's cats. Assign a value to the variable that states Morrey has 12 cats.<br><br>
2. One of Morrey's cats got pregnant and now Morrey has a new litter of kitties. There are 4 kitties in the litter. Add 4 cats to the total number of cats variable.<br><br>
3. On Monday, Morrey wants to give each cat some food. Create a new variable and assign a value that states the total amount of cat food is 1500 grams.<br><br>
4. Print the _remainder_ amount of cat food when each of Morrey's cats is given 50 grams. Use the two variables you previously created to complete this task.<br><br>
5. __BONUS__ How many grams would each cat get the next day (Tuesday) with only the remainder of the amount of cat food on Monday?<br><br>

####More Practice:
* Create variable ```valueone``` and ```valuetwo``` with different values. _Assign_ the second variable to the first with ```=```. What is the value of the variable ```valueone```?<br><br>
* What value is assigned to the variables in each line? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    
    return 0;
}
```
<br>
* What value is assigned to the variables in each line? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 3, b = 4;
    a = b;
    b = a;
    
    return 0;
}
```
<br>
* What value is assigned to the variables in each line? Explain what happens to the variables.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x = 4;
    int y = x + 1;
    x = x + 2;
    
    return 0;
}
```
<br>
* Play around with the precedence of operators. (Ex. The computer does ```**``` before any other operator, then goes on to do ```*``` and ```/```. Use at least 3 variables and all of the operators above.<br><br>
* Make a program similar to the example above, depicting the cost of university tuition and events (with a monetary value) that lower __or__ increase debt during college. Use at least 5 different variables.
