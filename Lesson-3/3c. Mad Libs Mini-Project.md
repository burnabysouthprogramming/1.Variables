#Try It Yourself - Practice Project

__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

This week we will be making a __Mad Libs__ program.<br><br>
There are no example of this program because I want you to think for yourself about how to make it with the tools I have given you so far. Programming is based on your own thinking and problem solving in order to accomplish a task.<br>
Also, if you don't know what Mad Libs is, go search it up or ask a friend.<br>
So far, we have learned __variables__, __printf__, and __scanf__. These topics will aid you in creating the program.<br><br>

##Mad Libs Project
I want you to create a working Mad Libs program (whether it's PG rated or not).<br><br>
__Criteria__:<br>
1. Write your own Mad Libs layout, or get one [online] (https://www.google.ca/search?site=&source=hp&q=mad+libs+online&oq=mad+libs+online&gs_l=hp.3..35i39j0l9.1876.4254.0.4704.17.16.0.0.0.0.264.2544.0j8j5.13.0....0...1c.1.64.hp..6.11.2151.0.2FYqU9mjILo).<br><br>
2. Your program/Mad Libs must contain at least 10 variables. They can be strings/words or values. If the one you got online does not have 10 values to input, add more sentences and include more information. <br><br>
3. Initialize ALL variables at the top of your ```main``` function. <br><br>
4. Use the ```scanf``` function to ask the user to input a value. Assign the respective values to each variable. You should do this in multiple lines for the sake of organization. <br><br>
5. Afterwards, use the ```printf``` function to write out the entire Mad Libs story. <br><br>
6. Share with your friends and have your friend next to you complete your Mad Libs. <br><br>

##PLEASE SAVE YOUR PROJECT -> EMAIL IT TO kallentu@hotmail.ca

__Save all completed work by pressing "Share Project" on the top left and saving the URL in an email to either yourself or kallentu@hotmail.ca. Files sent to Kallen will be put on this GitHub account. Answers to the exercises will be posted here before the next club day.__
