#Text-Based Game

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

With this project, you can __work alone or up to groups of 3__.

We will be making a text-based game in C in order to segway into game programming.
Make a text-based __survival__ game using the skills you know.
Make sure to lay out your entire game plan and what you want to include in your game.
You will probably _need variables, if statements/switch statements etc._

Make sure the game includes at least 6 rooms/items to interact with. You can have multiple endings or just one, final ending.

__NEXT DAY BE SURE TO HAVE UNITY(32BIT) DOWNLOADED. THE PROGRAM IS AROUND 1GB BUT WE NEED MORE SPACE TO STORE PROJECT FILES, SO PREPARE AN 8GB+ USB.__
