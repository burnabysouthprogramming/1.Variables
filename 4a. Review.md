#Review
In the past few weeks, we have been doing input and output.

##Printf
The ```printf``` function allows the programmer to output to the computer. We use ```printf``` in order to write things out.<br><br>

__Width__ is the number of spaces the variable will take. <br>
__Precision__ is the number of spaces after the decimal the variable will have.<br>
And lastly, the __format__ is the symbol that represents your variable. It represents the variables that come chronologically after the comma.
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a,b;
    float c,d;

    a = 15;
    b = a / 2;
    printf("%d\n",b);
    printf("%3d\n",b);
    printf("%03d\n",b);

    c = 15.3;
    d = c / 3;
    printf("%3.2f\n",d);

    return 0;
}
```
Everything inside the quotation marks will be shown in the output. We can write sentences inside the quotation marks, and we also use __escape sequences__ such as ```\n```.
<br><br>

#Scanf
The simplest application of scanf looks like this:
```c
scanf("%d", &age);
```
The program will read in an integer value that the user enters on the keyboard (%d is for integers, as is in ```printf```, so age must be declared as an int) and place that value into b. <br><br>
Like ```printf```, the ```%d``` correlates to the variable after the comma and the quotation marks.<br>
The ```&age``` part is called a __pointer__. They will be discussed later. <br>
__You MUST put & in front of the variable used in scanf. The reason why will become clear once you learn about pointers. It is easy to forget the & sign, and when you forget it your program will almost always crash when you run it.__

#Char Arrays in Scanf
A very important part to learn is char arrays. We will be discussing arrays in a later lesson, however for now just know that we use char arrays to define a space for more than one character.<br><br>

With ```char``` we can only assign the value of one character. With an array of a ```char```, we can assign whole sentences to one variable. <br><br>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  /* Define temporary variables */
  char name[10]; //Or char name[];
  int age;

  /* Ask the user to enter their first name and age */
  printf("Please enter your first name and your age.\n");

  /* Read a name and age from the user */
  scanf("%s %d", &name, &age);

  /* Display the values the user entered */
  printf("Name: %s\n", name);
  printf("Age: %d\n", age);

  return 0;
}
```
We can see with this program that we are able to initialize new variables for the values that the user inputs. We do not assign a value to the variables yet. We print out a statement asking for name and age, however we should note that __the answers are separated by a space.__ When we enter a few values at a time, they are separated by spaces. We can test this out on our own time.<br>
Next the computer gets the values from the user and assigns it to the variables. Then we are able to print out the values we received from the user.
<br><br>
Put this program into the compiler to understand it. We put the inputs within the Terminal.
<br><br>
The ```char name[10];``` line defines a char array that has the size of 10. If you know how many characters the input will take, write a number in the array (and add 1 to it because it will also take ```/0``` which is the null character), however if you do not know, then leave it empty so the computer can make the size for you.
