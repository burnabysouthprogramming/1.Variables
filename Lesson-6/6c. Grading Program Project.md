#Grading Program Project

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

With this project, __work alone or up to groups of 3. __

We will be making a Grading Program that gives out an output of what their grade is for a certain percentage the user puts in. We will use __variables, operators (both basic and conditional), printf, scanf, switch statements/if statements, and functions.__

##Grading Program Project
Our objective: __Create a program that allows the user to enter the grade they scored in a class. Afterwards, tell them what grade they have in that class.__<br><br>
_OPTIONAL: If you want, you can include an option that allows users to enter their marks and the total of their marks. (This will be a bit more complicated and take more time, do this only if you so desire.)_

1. (Always plan first) Plan out the structure of your program, whether you write it down, have an idea in your head or tell your partner(s). Plan out what you need and what functions you will need.<br><br>
2. Start your program by introducing the grading machine and provide instructions for the user to follow and input his/her percentage.<br><br>
3. Initialize any and all variables at the top (unless they are in the function, then you initialize them within the function).<br><br>
4. Use ```printf``` to list out instructions and give the results of the program.<br><br>
5. Use ```scanf``` to gather the user's input on their percentage in their class.<br><br>
6. __Use however many functions you think is necessary in order to calculate which grade they have and send it back to the ```main``` function to print out.__ Determine the parameters and return types needed for the function and call it from the ```main``` function. This is the function whose task is to determine the grade from the percent you provide it with in the parameters and return the grade.<br><br>
7. Use _switch statements or if statements_ within the function to determine their grade and the range of the grades.<br><br>
8. Have the people next to you try your program and look at other people's programs to see what they did differently.<br><br>
