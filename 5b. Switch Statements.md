A __switch__ statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each __switch case__. Switches are another way of branching within programming.

##Syntax

The switch statement is __very similar to an if statement with a few exceptions__. If you are not familiar with if statements, go back to review Lesson 4. 

However with switch statements, it evaluates an __integral variable (whether it be an integer or character)__ and each constant-expression is the __same data type__. 

If the variable matches a __constant-expression then the statements underneath it will be executed until a break statement is reached__. The ```default``` is similar to an ```else``` in an if statement; it is the default if no other conditions match.

```c
switch(expression) {

   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
	
   case constant-expression  :
      statement(s);
      break; /* optional */
  
   /* you can have any number of case statements */
   default : /* Optional */
   statement(s);
}
```

Case constant-expressions __end with a colon.__ The expressions should not be a ```float``` or any floating variable (a variable with decimals).

Two or more switch statements can share only one break. As well, nesting a switch statement within another is also possible.

##Switch Statement Rules & Guidelines

<img src = "http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/images/switch_statement.jpg">

* The __expression__ used in a __switch__ statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.

* You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.

* The __constant-expression__ for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal.

* When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a __break__ statement is reached.

* When a __break__ statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.

* Not every case needs to contain a __break__. If no __break__ appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.

* A __switch__ statement can have an optional __default__ case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No __break__ is needed in the default case.

* Case constant-expressions must be unique. You cannot have two of the same expression in a switch statement.

##Switch Statement Examples

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   char grade = 'B';

   switch(grade) {
      case 'A' :
         printf("Excellent!\n" );
         break;
      case 'B' :
      case 'C' :
         printf("Well done\n" );
         break;
      case 'D' :
         printf("You passed\n" );
         break;
      case 'F' :
         printf("Better try again\n" );
         break;
      default :
         printf("Invalid grade\n" );
   }
   
   printf("Your grade is  %c\n", grade );
 
   return 0;
}
```

```c
switch(roll)
       {
       case 1 :
               printf("C Programming Language");
               break;
       default:
               printf("No Student Found");
               break;
       case 2 :
               printf("C++ Programming Language");
               break;
       case 2 :
               printf("Web Technology");
               break;
        }
```

```c
switch(roll)
       {
       case 1 :
               printf("C Programming Language");
               break;
       case 2 :
               printf("C++ Programming Language");
               break;
       case 2 :
               printf("Web Technology");
               break;
        }
```
This is __NOT__ allowed: (The switch statement is very specific)

```c
switch(num)
       {
       case >15:
               printf("Number > 15");
               break;
       case =15:
               printf("Number = 15");
               break;
       case <15:
               printf("Number < 15");
               break;
        }
```
