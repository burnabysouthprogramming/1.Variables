#Vending Machine Project

[C Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php)<br><br>
__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

With this project, work __alone or up to groups of 3__. <br><br>
We will be making a __Vending Machine__ that gives out an output for a certain input the user puts in.
We will use __variables, operators (both basic and conditional), printf, scanf,__ and __switch statements__.

##Vending Machine Project
Our objective: __Create a program that presents the user with a choice of at least 5 items (drinks or food or other choices). Then allow the user to choose an item by entering a number from 1-5 (or to however many items you have). Afterwards, the output should show the user what item they chose and have a small description about it.__

1. Write out a plan of what your vending machine to include. You have artistic freedom so you can choose anything from carbonated drinks to video games to clothing accessories. You must have __at least 5 items__. <br><br>
2. Start your program by introducing the user to your vending machine and list all your items neatly for the user to input. Include instructions so the user knows to write a letter or a number instead of the item name.<br><br>
3. Initialize any and all variables at the top of the ```main``` function.<br><br>
4. Use ```printf``` to write instructions, information, and all the outputs for when the user chooses something from the vending machine.<br><br>
5. Use ```scanf``` to obtain the users input.<br><br>
6. Use ```switch statements``` to decide what output to give the user with the choices they made.<br><br>
7. With each output, print it out for the user to see what they get and add a little description to every item. You can also make surprises and make the vending machine even more complex (with nested if statements and switch statements)if you have time.<br><br>
8. Have the people next to you try your program and share it with your friends!
