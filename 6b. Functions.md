__NOTE: This compiler is not as forgiving if you refresh the page. YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR CODE. Be sure to transfer the code to notepad every few minutes or copy and paste. If the compiler idles, then you have the code copied and you can refresh to paste it back in.__

A __function__ is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is __main()__, and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.

###Why Do We Need Functions? Why Are They Important?

__The most important functional  question is why do we need a function? Functions have many uses. For example, a programmer may have a block of code that he has repeated forty times throughout the program. A function to execute that code would save a great deal of space, and it would also make the program more readable. Also, having only one copy of the code makes it easier to make changes. Would you rather make forty little changes scattered all throughout a potentially large program, or one change to the function body? So would I.__

__Another reason for functions is to break down a complex program into logical parts. For example, take a menu program that runs complex code when a menu choice is selected. The program would probably best be served by making functions for each of the actual menu choices, and then breaking down the complex tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks, which could be in their own functions. In this way, a program can be designed that makes sense when read. And has a structure that is easier to understand quickly. The worst programs usually only have the required function, main, and fill it with pages of jumbled code.__



You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task. Functions work like song lyrics where the chorus is like the function and after a verse, they write "Chorus" instead of the entire stanza of the chorus. You can similarly call a function the same way.

##Types of Functions
There are two types of functions in C programming:

* Library function
* User defined function

__Library functions__ are built in with the program and can be added using libraries (such as ```#include <stdio.h>```). Such functions include ones you've already learned like ```main()```, ```printf()```, and ```scanf()```.

__User Defined Functions__ are more specific and allow the user to call a function that they can customize themselves.

##Function Parts
A function declaration tells the compiler about a __function's name, return type, and parameters__. A function definition provides the actual body of the function. _A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc._

```c
/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2) {

   /* local variable declaration */
   int result;
 
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
 
   return result; 
}
```

* __Return Type__ − A function may return a value. The ```int``` before ```max``` (or the function name) is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return type would be the keyword ```void```. The returned value is the value that is brought back to when you called the function.<br><br>
* __Function Name__ − This is the __actual name__ of the function. The programmer must make this name descriptive just like any other variable assignment. The function name in this example is ```max```.<br><br>
* __Parameters__ − Parameters are the __information you pass to the function__ and when written at the top of the function like ```int num1, int num2```, they tell the program what types of information they are looking for. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. _Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters._<br><br>
* __Function Body__ − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does. The body is all the work and information on the inside of the function, between its curly braces. It is similar to all the work you once did in the ```main()``` function except it's now a new function.<br><br>

##Calling a Function

__Remember to always write your functions above the ```main()``` function because the computer reads from top to bottom and if they cannot find your user defined function before your ```main()``` then it cannot perform the desired task.__

While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to __call that function to perform the defined task.__

When a program calls a function, the program control is __transferred to the called function__. __A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.__

To call a function, you simply need to __pass the required parameters along with the function name__, and if the function returns a value, then you can __store the returned value.__ For example −

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
/* function declaration */
int max(int num1, int num2);
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
   int b = 200;
   int ret;
 
   /* calling a function to get max value */
   ret = max(a, b);
 
   printf( "Max value is : %d\n", ret );
 
   return 0;
}
 
/* function returning the max between two numbers */
int max(int num1, int num2) {

   /* local variable declaration */
   int result;
 
   if (num1 > num2)
      result = num1;
   else
      result = num2;
 
   return result; 
}
```

##Function Arguments (Parameters)
If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the formal parameters of the function.

Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.

This is also known as the __scope__. The variables within a function will not be affected by the variables outside the function and will not affect variables outside the function.
##More Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int mult ( int x, int y );

int main()
{
  int x;
  int y;
  
  printf( "Please input two numbers to be multiplied: " );
  scanf( "%d", &x );
  scanf( "%d", &y );
  printf( "The product of your two numbers is %d\n", mult( x, y ) );
  getchar(); 
}

int mult (int x, int y)
{
  return x * y;
}
```

```c
int addition(int num1, int num2)
{
     int sum
     /* Arguments are used here*/
     sum = num1+num2;

     /* function return type is integer so I should return some
     integer value */
     return sum
}

int main()
{
     int var1, var2;
     printf("enter number 1: ");
     scanf("%d",&var1);
     printf("enter number 2: ");
     scanf("%d",&var2);

     /* calling function – function return type is integer so I would be 
      * needing to store the returned value in some integer variable */
     int res = addition(var1, var2);
     printf ("Output: %d", res);

     return 0;
}
```

```c
/* function return type is void and doesn't have parameters*/
void introduction()
{
    printf("Hi\n");
    printf("My name is Chaitanya\n");
    printf("How are you?");
    /* there is no return statement inside this function, since its
     * return type is void */
}

int main()
{
     /*calling function*/
     introduction();
     return 0;
}
```

Learning about return types and how they work (In this case, the return value is assigned to ```c1```.) -
```c
char abc(char ch1, char ch2)
{
   char ch3;
   …
   …
   return ch3;
}

int main()
{
   …
   char c1 = abc('a', 'x');
   …
}
```
