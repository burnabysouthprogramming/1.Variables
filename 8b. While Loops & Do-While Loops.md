#While Loops & Do-While Loops

While loops and Do While loops are similar to For loops and can function similarly.

__While Loops and then Do While Loops__

The key point to note is that a while loop might not execute at all. When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.


##While Loops
The syntax of a while loop in C programming language is −
```c
while(condition) {
   statement(s);
}
```

Here, __statement(s)__ may be a single statement or a block of statements. The __condition__ may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

When the condition becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

##While Loop Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 10;

   /* while loop execution */
   while( a < 20 ) {
      printf("value of a: %d\n", a);
      a++;
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −

```c
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
```


Write a C program to find the factorial of a number, where the number is entered by user. (Hints: factorial of n = 1*2*3*...*n

```c
/*C program to demonstrate the working of while loop*/
#include <stdio.h>
     int main(){
     int number,factorial;
     printf("Enter a number.\n");
     scanf("%d",&number);
     factorial=1;
     while (number>0){      /* while loop continues util test condition number>0 is true */
           factorial=factorial*number;
           --number;
}
printf("Factorial=%d",factorial);
return 0;
}
```

```c
..
main()
{
    int count=1;
    while (count <=4)
    {
        printf("%d ", count);
        count++;
    }
}
```
##Do While Loops
Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the __top of the loop__, the __do...while__ loop in C programming checks its condition at the __bottom of the loop.__

__A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.__

The syntax of a do...while loop in C programming language is −
```c
do {
   statement(s);
} while( condition );
```
Notice that the conditional expression appears at the end of the loop, so the statement(s) in the loop executes once before the condition is tested.

If the condition is true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the statement(s) in the loop executes again. This process repeats until the given condition becomes false.

##Do While Examples
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 10;

   /* do loop execution */
   do {
      printf("value of a: %d\n", a);
      a = a + 1;
   }while( a < 20 );
 
   return 0;
}
```
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
```c
value of a: 10
value of a: 11
value of a: 12
value of a: 13
value of a: 14
value of a: 15
value of a: 16
value of a: 17
value of a: 18
value of a: 19
```

Write a C program to add all the numbers entered by a user until user enters 0.

```c
/*C program to demonstrate the working of do...while statement*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   int sum=0,num;
   do             /* Codes inside the body of do...while loops are at least executed once. */
   {                                    
        printf("Enter a number\n");
        scanf("%d",&num);
        sum+=num;      
   }
   while(num!=0);
   printf("sum=%d",sum);
return 0;
}
```

```c
main()
{
     int i=0
     do
     {
        printf("while vs do-while\n");
     }while(i==1);
     printf("Out of loop");
}
```
##Break and Continue
Two keywords that are very important to looping are break and continue. The break command will exit the most immediately surrounding loop regardless of what the conditions of the loop are. Break is useful if we want to exit a loop under special circumstances. For example, let's say the program we're working on is a two-person checkers game. The basic structure of the program might look like this:
```c
while (true) 
{
    take_turn(player1);
    take_turn(player2);
}
```
This will make the game alternate between having player 1 and player 2 take turns. The only problem with this logic is that there's no way to exit the game; the loop will run forever! Let's try something like this instead:
```c
while(true)
{
    if (someone_has_won() || someone_wants_to_quit() == TRUE)
    {break;}
    take_turn(player1);
    if (someone_has_won() || someone_wants_to_quit() == TRUE)
    {break;}
    take_turn(player2);
}
```
This code accomplishes what we want--the primary loop of the game will continue under normal circumstances, but under a special condition (winning or exiting) the flow will stop and our program will do something else.
Continue is another keyword that controls the flow of loops. If you are executing a loop and hit a continue statement, the loop will stop its current iteration, update itself (in the case of for loops) and begin to execute again from the top. Essentially, the continue statement is saying "this iteration of the loop is done, let's continue with the loop without executing whatever code comes after me." Let's say we're implementing a game of Monopoly. Like above, we want to use a loop to control whose turn it is, but controlling turns is a bit more complicated in Monopoly than in checkers. The basic structure of our code might then look something like this:
```c
for (player = 1; someone_has_won == FALSE; player++)
    {
        if (player > total_number_of_players)
        {player = 1;}
        if (is_bankrupt(player))
        {continue;}
        take_turn(player);
    }
```
This way, if one player can't take her turn, the game doesn't stop for everybody; we just skip her and keep going with the next player's turn.
