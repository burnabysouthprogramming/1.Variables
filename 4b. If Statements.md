There are two types of control within programming. There is __branching__ and __looping__. These next few weeks, we will be focusing on branching which is when the computer chooses one choice over another.

If statements are very important in programming. They are also the simplest form of branching. If statements takes an expression in parenthesis and an statement or block of statements. If the expression is true then the statement or block of statements gets executed otherwise these statements are skipped.

##Basic Syntax
Before discussing the actual structure of the if statement, let us examine the meaning of TRUE and FALSE in computer terminology. A true statement is one that evaluates to a nonzero number. A false statement evaluates to zero. When you perform comparison with the relational operators, the operator will return 1 if the comparison is true, or 0 if the comparison is false. For example, the check 0 == 2 evaluates to 0. The check 2 == 2 evaluates to a 1. If this confuses you, try to use a printf statement to output the result of those various comparisons (for example printf ( "%d", 2 == 1 );) 
<br><br>
If statements look like this:
```c
if (expression) {
  statement;
}

if ( 5 < 10 ) {
  printf( "Five is now less than ten, that's a big surprise" );
}
```

If the expression is true, the computer will go into the brackets and execute the statement. If it is not true, then the computer will ignore the if statement (like how it ignores a comment) and skip over it.

##Else
So the if statement is ignored by the computer since the expression is not true, and you write a new if statement for a condition that is opposite of what you already wrote. Now, instead we should use the else statement.
```c
if (a > 2) { 
  a = 5;
} //The else statement attaches directly underneath the if statement and when a is not greater than 2, 
else { //The computer will fall back to the else statement.
  a = 3;
}
```
The else statement acts as a default. So if no conditions prove to be true, it will go to the else section of the if statement.

##Else If
With an if statement, we can connect only one else segment and we can only have one if segment, but what if we need more conditions for the one if statement?<br><br>
In that case, we can add else if into the if statement. An else if allows the programmer to apply another specific condition for the if statement. 
```c
#include <stdio.h>	

int main()                            /* Most important part of the program!  */
{
    int age;                          /* Need a variable... */
  
    printf( "Please enter your age" );  /* Asks for age */
    scanf( "%d", &age );                 /* The input is put in age */
    if ( age < 100 ) {                  /* If the age is less than 100 */
        printf ("You are pretty young!\n" ); /* Just to show you it works... */
    }
    else if ( age == 100 ) {            /* I use else just to show an example */ 
        printf( "You are old\n" );       
    }
    else {
        printf( "You are really old\n" );     /* Executed if no other statement is */
    }
  return 0;
}
```

##Conditional Operators
Boolean operators allow you to create more complex conditional statements. For example, if you wish to check if a variable is both greater than five and less than ten, you could use the Boolean AND to ensure both var > 5 and var < 10 are true. The C symbols are not: OR, AND, NOT, although they are of equivalent function. 

When using if statements, you will often wish to check multiple different conditions. You must understand the Boolean operators OR, NOT, and AND. The boolean operators function in a similar way to the comparison operators: each returns 0 if evaluates to FALSE or 1 if it evaluates to TRUE. 

__NOT:__ The NOT operator accepts one input. If that input is TRUE, it returns FALSE, and if that input is FALSE, it returns TRUE. For example, NOT (1) evaluates to 0, and NOT (0) evaluates to 1. NOT (any number but zero) evaluates to 0. In C NOT is written as !. NOT is evaluated prior to both AND and OR. 

__AND:__ This is another important command. AND returns TRUE if both inputs are TRUE (if 'this' AND 'that' are true). (1) AND (0) would evaluate to zero because one of the inputs is false (both must be TRUE for it to evaluate to TRUE). (1) AND (1) evaluates to 1. (any number but 0) AND (0) evaluates to 0. The AND operator is written && in C. Do not be confused by thinking it checks equality between numbers: it does not. Keep in mind that the AND operator is evaluated before the OR operator. 

__OR:__ Very useful is the OR statement! If either (or both) of the two values it checks are TRUE then it returns TRUE. For example, (1) OR (0) evaluates to 1. (0) OR (0) evaluates to 0. The OR is written as || in C. Keep in mind that OR will be evaluated after AND. 

It is possible to combine several Boolean operators in a single statement; often you will find doing so to be of great value when creating complex expressions for if statements. What is !(1 && 0)? Of course, it would be TRUE. It is true is because 1 && 0 evaluates to 0 and !0 evaluates to TRUE (i.e., 1). 

Here are the common operators that you will need to learn and use:
```c
>     /* greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE */
<     /* less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE */
>=    /* greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE */
<=    /* less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE */
==    /* equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE */
!=    /* not equal to              5 != 4 is TRUE */
```

##Complex If Statements & Examples
If statements can be as long and as nested as you need. Nested if statements are if statements within if statements. I won't show any examples of that here because I want you to try it on your own.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   /* local variable definition */
   int a = 100;
 
   /* check the boolean condition */
   if( a == 10 ) {
      /* if condition is true then print the following */
      printf("Value of a is 10\n" );
   }
   else if( a == 20 ) {
      /* if else if condition is true */
      printf("Value of a is 20\n" );
   }
   else if( a == 30 ) {
      /* if else if condition is true  */
      printf("Value of a is 30\n" );
   }
   else {
      /* if none of the conditions is true */
      printf("None of the values is matching\n" );
   }
   
   printf("Exact value of a is: %d\n", a );
 
   return 0;
}
```
