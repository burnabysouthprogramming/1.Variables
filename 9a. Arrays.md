__What is an array?__

An array is a collection of same type of elements which are sheltered under a common name.

An array can be visualised as a row in a table, whose each successive block can be thought of as memory bytes containing one element. Look at the figure below :

An Array of four elements:
```
+===================================================+
| elem1     |  elem2      | elem3      | elem4      |
+===================================================+
```
The number of 8 bit bytes that each element occupies depends on the type of array. If type of array is ‘char’ then it means the array stores character elements. Since each character occupies one byte so elements of a character array occupy one byte each.

__What’s the need of an array?__

Consider a scenario wherein you have to store 100 integer numbers, entered by user, in order to find out the average of them. To program this scenario you have two ways – 1) Define 100 variable of integer type and at last perform the average operation. 2) Have a single integer array to store all the values.

Which solution is better as per you? Obviously the second solution, it is convenient to store same data types in one single variable and later access them using array index (we will discuss it later in this tutorial).
