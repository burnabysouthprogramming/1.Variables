__What is an array?__

An array is a collection of same type of elements which are sheltered under a common name.

An array can be visualised as a row in a table, whose each successive block can be thought of as memory bytes containing one element. Look at the figure below :

An Array of four elements:
```
+===================================================+
| elem1     |  elem2      | elem3      | elem4      |
+===================================================+
```
The number of 8 bit bytes that each element occupies depends on the type of array. If type of array is ‘char’ then it means the array stores character elements. Since each character occupies one byte so elements of a character array occupy one byte each.

__What’s the need of an array?__

Consider a scenario wherein you have to store 100 integer numbers, entered by user, in order to find out the average of them. To program this scenario you have two ways – 1) Define 100 variable of integer type and at last perform the average operation. 2) Have a single integer array to store all the values.

Which solution is better as per you? Obviously the second solution, it is convenient to store same data types in one single variable and later access them using array index (we will discuss it later in this tutorial).

##Defining an Array

An array is defined as following :
```
<type-of-array> <name-of-array> [<number of elements in array>];
```

__type-of-array__: It is the type of elements that an array stores. If array stores character elements then type of array is ‘char’. If array stores integer elements then type of array is ‘int’. Besides these native types, if type of elements in array is structure objects then type of array becomes the structure.

__name-of-array__: This is the name that is given to array. It can be any string but it is usually suggested that some can of standard should be followed while naming arrays. At least the name should be in context with what is being stored in the array.

__[number of elements]__: This value in subscripts [] indicates the number of elements the array stores.
For example, an array of five characters can be defined as :
```
char arr[5];
```

##Initializing an Array
You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows −
```c
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```
The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].

If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write −
```c
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
```
You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array −
```c
balance[4] = 50.0;
```
The above statement assigns the 5th element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1.

##Accessing Array Elements
An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example −
```c
double salary = balance[9];
```
The above statement will take the 10th element from the array and assign the value to salary variable. The following example Shows how to use all the three above mentioned concepts viz. declaration, assignment, and accessing arrays −
```c
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main () {

   int n[ 10 ]; /* n is an array of 10 integers */
   int i,j;
 
   /* initialize elements of array n to 0 */         
   for ( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
      n[ i ] = i + 100; /* set element at location i to i + 100 */
   }
   
   /* output each array element's value */
   for (j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) {
      printf("Element[%d] = %d\n", j, n[j] );
   }
 
   return 0;
}
```
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −
```
Element[0] = 100
Element[1] = 101
Element[2] = 102
Element[3] = 103
Element[4] = 104
Element[5] = 105
Element[6] = 106
Element[7] = 107
Element[8] = 108
Element[9] = 109
```
