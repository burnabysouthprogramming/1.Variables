What is an array?

An array is a collection of same type of elements which are sheltered under a common name.

An array can be visualised as a row in a table, whose each successive block can be thought of as memory bytes containing one element. Look at the figure below :

An Array of four elements:
```
+===================================================+
| elem1     |  elem2      | elem3      | elem4      |
+===================================================+
```
The number of 8 bit bytes that each element occupies depends on the type of array. If type of array is ‘char’ then it means the array stores character elements. Since each character occupies one byte so elements of a character array occupy one byte each.
