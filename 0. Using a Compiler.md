#Using a Compiler

[Python Compiler - Click here] (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python_online.php)<br>

1. You can completely delete the Hello World program. __Write code inside the space.__ Keep in mind that code is read one line at a time so don't try to scrunch up all your code on one line.
2. Click __Execute__ button on the top left to compile your code.
3. Compiled code will appear in the __green box__ otherwise called the Terminal. Ignore ```sh-4.3$``` and your output should appear underneath it.
4. If there is a problem or a bug in your script, the Terminal will show an error message. The error will contain the line number and the problem sometimes. <br> ```File "main.py", line 2``` If there is an error, find the problem then compile again.
5. The box left of your script contains multiple scripts or just your "main" script if you are only using one.
6. You can __Save__ by hovering over __File__ in the top right. You can save a file to send to your USB or email.
7. You can __Share__ your script by clicking __Share Project__ next to the Execute button. Agree to the disclaimer and copy and paste the URL given. If you want your script shown in the Burnaby South Programming Club GitHub, then email the url to kallentu@hotmail.ca
